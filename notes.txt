STMFD instruction:
	Store Multiple (Full, Descending Stack) - store multiple registers to the stack,
	where the stack pointer points to the last used word on the stack and the stack
	grows downward toward 0x0. Registers are saved sequentially according to their
	register number, starting with the lowest numbers
	EG
	stmfd	sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
	is usually near the beginning of a subroutine, and will store the
	frame pointer(?) ip(?), link register, and program counter to the stack, saving
	an incremented value back into sp (

pc - r15, Program Counter
lr - r14, Link Register
sp - r13, Stack Pointer
ip - r12, interprocedural scratch
fp - r11, frame pointer
sl - r10, ???
